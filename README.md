# Tutorial on Tensors, Vectorization, Embedding, Batch Processing, Epochs, and Functional & Sequential APIs

Welcome to the tutorial repository! This repository provides a comprehensive tutorial covering various essential concepts in machine learning and deep learning. Below is an overview of the topics covered:

## Topics Covered

### 1. Tensors
Learn about tensors, the fundamental data structures used in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Understand tensor properties, operations, and manipulation.

### 2. Vectorization
Explore the concept of vectorization and its importance in optimizing computational efficiency in machine learning and deep learning. Learn how to perform vectorized operations on arrays and matrices.

### 3. Embedding
Dive into embeddings, which are learned representations of data in a continuous vector space. Understand how embeddings capture semantic relationships and are utilized in natural language processing (NLP), recommender systems, and more.

### 4. Batch Processing
Understand the significance of batch processing in training deep learning models. Learn how mini-batch gradient descent improves computational efficiency and convergence speed.

### 5. Epochs
Explore epochs, which represent one complete pass through the entire training dataset during model training. Understand how the number of epochs affects model convergence and performance.

### 6. Functional & Sequential APIs
Discover the two primary APIs for building deep learning models in Keras: the functional API and the sequential API. Learn when and how to use each API for constructing complex neural network architectures.
